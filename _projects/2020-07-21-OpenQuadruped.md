## Introduction

Most of my experience with robotics going into this project was in the scope of drive systems and 6/7DOF robotic arms. Inspired by Boston Dynamics's Spot robot, I decided to design a fully 3d-printed quadruped, which would merge the inverse kinematics techniques I learned when working with the high-DOF robotic arms and the high level path generation, pursuit, correction, and optimization techniques I learned when working with nonholonomic drive systems. Of course, a quadruped presented new challenges that I had yet to face, such as gait planning & the difficulty of global pose estimation, but as you read through this blog post

## Design Process

My first step was to decide on the motors I wanted to use. I had it narrowed down to two options. Firstly, I could go the brushed motor route (very similar to what I had done previously in FRC), characterize the motors and determine a voltage-velocity equation and solve for the arbitrary constants, then design and tune a velocity PID controller. Although familiar, I really wanted to take my precision and accuracy up a notch, so I decided to go the second route. The second option (that I picked) was to use stepper motors, which are inherently accurate and precise (assuming the load isn't too large), since I would just be able to tell the motors to go to a velocity and assume they reached it semi-instantaneously. An added benefit was not having to worry about encoders.

This design choice came in the form of NEMA-17 motors and DRV-8825 stepper drivers. Electronics-wise, I decided on using an arduino nano for interfacing with the stepper drivers, and a raspberry pi for all the higher-level control and controller interface.

I then designed and 3D-printed the precision platform, seen here:

</div>

You can find the source code for base control (for both the arduino & RPi) [on my github.](https://github.com/adham-elarabawy/Precision-Drivetrain-Platform)

I also created a custom drive controller board that handled the interface between the arduino nano and the DRV stepper drivers:

</div>

By this point, I could drive the robot with an xbox controller by using some simple differential drive logic to map the joystick values to velocities for the left & right sides of the drivetrain.

<div class="centered">
{% highlight python %}
def arcade_drive():
    joyX = -joy.leftX()
    joyY = joy.leftY()

    if (abs(joyX) < 0.1):
        joyX = 0
    if (abs(joyY) < 0.1):
        joyY = 0

    pwrL = clamp(joyY-joyX, -1, 1)
    pwrR = clamp(joyY+joyX, -1, 1)

    spdL = pwrL * max_speed
    spdR = pwrR * max_speed

    return spdL, spdR
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

## Path Generation & Pursuit

Now that I had a working drivetrain that I could precisely control, I decided to implement a path generation and pursuit suite. The basic premise is as follows: I wanted to be able to select waypoints with a specified heading (global yaw), and the suite should find a continuous path of continuous curvature (since this is a differential drive after all) constrained by the selected waypoints. Then, I wanted the suite to create a time-parametrized trajectory from the aforementioned path using the velocity and acceleration constraints of the platform.

This didn't turn out to be trivial. After doing some research, I decided that I wanted to use Quintic Hermite Spline interpolation to determine the path, since it is the only option that I could find that had C2 continuity (curvature continuity) & properly constrained the output path to the given waypoints and their specified tangents. The more popular options (i.e. Bezier Curves & Cubic Hermite Splines) either only had C1 continuity (which would result in jerky turning) or didn't actually *constrain* the path to the points, rather merely getting the path somewhat close to the points. The below chart summarizes the clear disadvantage of cubic splines quite well, and [this paper](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~lau/students/Sprunk2008.pdf) outlined the choice for quintic hermite splines clearly.

*Note: If there is only one polynomial segment, the spline is often called a BÃ©zier curve. If each segment is described by its ending positions and derivatives, it is said to be in "Hermite" form.*

Then, it was just a matter of using a trapezoidal motion profile to find the corresponding velocity and acceleration for evenly spaced points to create a trajectory. But wait! Evenly spaced points? Well, it's quite hard to derive a fully continuous trajectory function, so what I did was determine the acceleration and velocity for a whole bunch of evenly spaced points on the path, then during runtime, I sample this model of the trajectory by passing in the elapsed time since the trajectory started, and I have a sample method that returns the estimated desired velocity by using simple linear interpolation. Since I have an excess of ~1000 control points on average, this is definitely more than accurate enough and it keeps this entire process fast enough to be sampled runtime.

Just because I like matplotlib (who doesn't?), I decided to make a simple visualization tool so that one can preview the path & trajectory before actually deploying to the robot. *Note: Keep in mind that the trajectory animation isn't 100% accurate, since matplotlib sometimes takes more time to plot the animation than the desired timestep.*

You can find the source code for the visualization tool [on my github.](https://github.com/adham-elarabawy/PyDataAnalysis/tree/master/src/common/interpolation)
*The file to run is `test_interface.py`*

Here's a little demo:

## Some fun!
I wanted to make a visualization tool for deriving quintic hermite splines, so while messing around with desmos, I decided to show all the control points, hermite basis functions, xy position/derivative/second derivative functions on the same plot. I found this to be quite aesthetically pleasing.
