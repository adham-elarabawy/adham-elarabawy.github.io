#### What is this?

In an effort to showcase my personal projects cohesively, I decided to create a portfolio website (the one you're on right now!).

#### Anything special?

I spent a little time creating css-only organically breathing blobs that are in the background of the website. I've experimented with a bunch of background effects using perlin noise and various particle effects, but I ended up quite liking this simple blurred blob design.

#### Future plans?
I am working on getting a 3d mesh of my brain constructed from a 3D mri scan obtained from my research lab. I have a few cool ideas on how to incorporate that into the design for this website using some cool 3d manipulations from three.js.

I'm also considering possibly adding a blog to this website so I can have a platform for technical discussion (and maybe a bit of philosophy and book reviews).
