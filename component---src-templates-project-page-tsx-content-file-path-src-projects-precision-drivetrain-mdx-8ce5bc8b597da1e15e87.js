I had it narrowed down to two options. Firstly, I could go the brushed motor route (very similar to what I had done previously in FRC), characterize the motors and determine a voltage-velocity equation and solve for the arbitrary constants, then design and tune a velocity PID controller. Although familiar, I really wanted to take my precision and accuracy up a notch, so I decided to go the second route. The second option (that I picked) was to use stepper motors, which are inherently accurate and precise (assuming the load isn't too large), since I would just be able to tell the motors to go to a velocity and assume they reached it semi-instantaneously. An added benefit was not having to worry about encoders."),"\n",a.createElement(t.p,null,"This design choice came in the form of NEMA-17 motors and DRV-8825 stepper drivers.
