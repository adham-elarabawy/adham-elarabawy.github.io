An excerpt that motivated this essay from a Q&A session after [Richard Hamming's popular "You and Your Research"](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html):

 > **Question:** How important is one's own expectation or how important is 
it to be in a group or surrounded by people who expect great work from you? 

 > **Hamming:** At Bell Labs everyone expected good work from me - it was a 
big help. Everybody expects you to do a good job, so you do, if you've got 
pride. I think it's very valuable to have first-class people around. I sought 
out the best people. The moment that physics table lost the best people, I left. 
The moment I saw that the same was true of the chemistry table, I left. I tried 
to go with people who had great ability so I could learn from them and who would 
expect great results out of me. *<span style={{ backgroundColor: '#ffffcc' }}>By deliberately managing myself, I think I did 
much better than laissez faire.</span>*
