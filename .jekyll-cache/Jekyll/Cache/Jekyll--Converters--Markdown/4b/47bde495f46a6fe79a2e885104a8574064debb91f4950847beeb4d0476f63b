<p>In order to better understand the gradient descent algorithm and its flaws, I decided to try and implement it from scratch using python and matplotlib (to visualize). After implementing the vanilla gradient descent algorithm, I started to add hyperparameters such as dynamic step size proportional to the gradient &amp; a momentum that would allow the scanning point to overcome local maximas to possibly find a greater (magnitude) absolute maxima.</p>
